Prototxt files that define models and solvers.

Three models are defined, with some variations of each to support experiments
in the paper.
 - Caffenet (model **S**)
 - VGG_CNN_M_1024 (model **M**)
 - VGG16 (model **L**)

There are five networks defined here:

ZF_YYY: corresponding the method A in the project paper.
ZF_anchor: anchor.
ZF_multiscale
ZF_res: residual net.
ZF_combination: Combination of all. Doesn't work very well actaully.
